-   define measurements that could be calculated from the current skeleton
        - Around colar:
            - calculate center of the bone: neck => nose
            - measure width in both front and side views at this point => calculate circumference of the elipse
        -
        - Acromial Height: from shoulder to base line
        - Ankle Circumference:
            - the silhouette doesn't separate two legs from each other.
            - the positions of LAnkle and RAnkle are not at the slice that are used to calculate circumference.
            - side view:
                - the other leg interferes in

-   find a better shoulder position
    problem:
        - the silhouette at contour is not exact.
